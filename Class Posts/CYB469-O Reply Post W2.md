### [Twilio's Authy App Breach Exposes Millions of Phone Numbers](https://thehackernews.com/2024/07/twilios-authy-app-breach-exposes.html)

**Article summary:**
Twilio disclosed a security breach as a response to a database leak exposing millions of users' phone numbers posted on the hacking forum “BreachForums”, where the attacker exploited an unauthenticated endpoint in the Authy app. Twilio secured the endpoint and recommends users to update their app and that threat actors may phishing and smishing attacks.

**How it applies:**
The article emphasizes the importance of monitoring and auditing endpoints as a KPI for security related to user information and account data. Ensuring that endpoints are properly authenticated and audited can help prevent data breaches and exposure of user information.

**What steps could have been taken to prevent the situation?:**
Twilio conducting security audits and implementing authentication on all of their endpoints could have prevented the unauthenticated endpoint being exploited. Monitoring for unusual activities can also help prevent further system breaches.

**What did they do right?:**
Twilio promptly secured the unauthenticated endpoint and informed users about the breach, recommending updating the app to the latest version. Twilio also warned users of potential phishing and smishing attacks.

**How will this impact cyber security or the info sec community?:**
The breach could make organizations reassess their security practices and make sure that their systems are properly secure and authenticated, specifically around endpoints that handle sensitive user information.

**Hello Deven,**

The article you chose covered a recent breach that exposed personal identifiable information (PII) for millions of users. The service that experienced the breach was Authy, which is a popular two-factor authentication (2FA) app owned by Twilio. Currently, the only data confirmed to have been breached are approximately 33 million phone numbers. The obtained data can be leveraged by threat actors in phishing and smishing attacks.

I agree with your interpretation of this event and its impact on the industries of cybersecurity and information security. Strengthening endpoint security is a very important step, especially when you are dealing with an authentication service used for 2FA or MFA. I understand that managing security for a users personal device can be a challenging thing, but maybe implementing better security mechanisms (e.g. behavioral analysis, biometrics, etc.) into the application on the endpoint side could have prevented this issue. Overall, your post was very informative and covered this event well.
