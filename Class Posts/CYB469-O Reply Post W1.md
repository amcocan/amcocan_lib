### [Truist bank confirms data breach](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/06/truist-bank-confirms-data-breach) 

**Article Summary:**
On June 12, 2024, a threat actor that goes by "Sp1d3r" offered data stolen from Truist Bank for sale on the Breach Forums site for $1,000,000. The data included employee records, bank transaction data, and IVR source code. Truist Bank confirmed the breach and stated it was quickly contained and was not a Snowflake related breach. 

**How it Applies:**
This data breach emphasizes the importance of proper cybersecurity detection and prevention protocols and practices for financial organizations that contain sensitive information. It underlines the importance of securing sensitive data and source code to prevent unauthorized access and exploitation. 

**Preventing the Situation:**
To prevent the data breach, Truist Bank should have implemented access controls, IDS/IPS and endpoint protection solutions on their systems and servers, vulnerability scanning and patching, regularly monitor for suspicious activity, and implemented proper employee training on cybersecurity practices and social engineering attempts. 

**What They Did Right:**
Truist Bank quickly contained the breach and conducted a thorough investigation. They communicated with affected customers and denied any relation to Snowflake. 

**Impact on Cybersecurity and the Info Sec:**
The breach will hopefully prompt financial organizations and other organizations that handle sensitive banking information to strengthen their cybersecurity practices and procedures. It also emphasizes the importance of threat intelligence sharing between organizations.

**Hello Deven,**

Your post was well organized and addressed a recent article on the Truist Bank breach, specifically the data being sold on Wednesday June 12, 2024. You also gave a detailed breakdown of the information on how it applies, what can be done to prevent similar situations, what was done right, and what impactful lessons can be applied in areas of cyber-sec and info-sec.
Looking at this detailed breakdown, I agree with your observations and suggestions. Banks are built on trust with their clients and can not afford to lose that trust. As a result, cybersecurity incidents should be addressed quickly and effectively. Additionally, banks (and any other business) should implement better stringent security policies and procedures, coupled with a very proactive stand on the detection and mitigation of threats. In this way, threat actors are discouraged from conducting a cyber attack or breach. This also helps with increasing and maintaining trust. Overall, you observations were very precise and your suggestions added good insight on what could have been done better. I hope to have the privilege of reading more of your work in the future.
