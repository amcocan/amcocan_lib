### **Hello Deven,**

It's awesome that you're so focused on your goals! Here are some thoughts on your plan: For passing the CySA+ exam, make sure to allocate enough study time and use practice exams to gauge your readiness. Joining study groups or forums for additional support can be very helpful. Regarding your goal of securing a SOC job within a year after graduation, networking is key. Attend cybersecurity conferences and local meetups, and connect with professionals on LinkedIn. This can lead to job opportunities and valuable advice. As for becoming a malware analyst or reverse engineer within five years, keep honing your skills in malware analysis and reverse engineering. Consider participating in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, which are great for practical experience. I also advise building a home lab that can be used to deepen your understanding of network behavior and give you a secure environment to reverse engineer malware for research.

I think MalwareBytes and Raytheon/RTX are solid choices given your career path. They offer robust experience and learning opportunities in cybersecurity. Another organization to consider is [Mandiant](https://www.mandiant.com/), known for their advanced threat detection and response. To join these organizations, stay active in the cybersecurity community, apply for internships or entry-level positions, and continuously improve your skills and certifications.

Additionally, you might want to check out newsletters and feeds like [The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com/), and [Krebs on Security](https://krebsonsecurity.com/). They provide comprehensive updates and deep dives into cybersecurity trends and incidents. In terms of professional certifications, Security+ is a great foundational cert. Make sure to keep up with Continuing EducationÂ Units (CEUs) to maintain it. The requirements for Security+ include passing the exam and earning CEUs every three years. The CySA+ is excellent for a SOC analyst role, so practice hands-on skills and stay current with security trends. Its requirements include passing the exam and earning CEUs every three years. Look into obtaining additional certifications like the Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) or the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) as you progress. They will further validate your skills and can open up more advanced roles. Keep pushing forward and stay curious! You've got a solid plan and the drive to make it happen. ðŸ˜„
