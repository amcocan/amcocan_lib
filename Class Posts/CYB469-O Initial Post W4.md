## **Hello Everyone,**
I would like to leverage my security degree and land a career as a penetration tester. I would especially love to work on Linux or Cloud Systems. Right now I see my self finishing my bachelors degree and studying for some certs. One year after graduation, I see my self working for a company (maybe a small to medium business) and having the following certifications: Network+, Security+, PennTest+, AZ900, and AZ600. Five years from graduation, I see myself working for a large company like Microsoft and working on growing in my career. Finally, 10 years from now I see myself working more in the private sector of cybersecurity as a contractor maybe even in areas of national security.

To accomplish my professional goals, I am getting my degree in Cybersecurity, along with some certifications. I am also studying in a security specialization that will give me some leverage in the industry. Learning has also become a part of my daily routine that shapes me into a better and smarter version of myself.

One of the most beneficial organizations for a career in cybersecurity within the USA would have to be NIST. I feel that NIST will be there to guide my decisions as a security professional and offer effective solutions that I can leverage to ensure a strong security posture is established and maintained. This is a priceless resource that will greatly impact my career.

One of the newsletters that I will remain subscribed to is "The Hacker News". This resource keeps me up to date with security related events and can serve as a guide to finding vulnerabilities or solutions to known vulnerabilities in the future.

As mentioned before, here is a list with some of the professional certifications I aim to hold. There are more not added to this list.
- Network+
- Security+
- PennTest+
- AZ900
- AZ600
