Terminal emulation is software that emulates the function of a terminal. It allows the use of text-based programs within a graphical user interface (`GUI`). There are also so-called command-line interfaces (`CLI`) that run as additional terminals in one terminal. In short, a terminal serves as an interface to the shell interpreter.

Terminal emulators and multiplexers are beneficial extensions for the terminal. They provide us with different methods and functions to work with the terminal, such as splitting the terminal into one window, working in multiple directories, creating different workspaces, and much more. An example of the use of such a multiplexer called Tmux could look something like this:
