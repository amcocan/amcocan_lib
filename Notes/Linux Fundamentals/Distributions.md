Linux distributions - or distros - are operating systems based on the Linux kernel. They are used for various purposes, from servers and embedded devices to desktop computers and mobile phones. Each Linux distribution is different, with its own set of features, packages, and tools. Some popular examples include:

- [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)
- [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/)
- [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/)
- [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)
- [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux)

Many users choose Linux for their desktop computers because it is free, open source, and highly customizable. Ubuntu and Fedora are two popular choices for desktop Linux and beginners. It is also widely used as a server operating system because it is secure, stable, and reliable and comes with frequent and regular updates. Finally, we, as cybersecurity specialists, often prefer Linux because it is open source, meaning its source code is available for scrutiny and customization. Because of such customization, we can optimize and customize our Linux distribution the way we want and configure it for specific use cases only if necessary.

We can use those distros everywhere, including (web) servers, mobile devices, embedded systems, cloud computing, and desktop computing. For cyber security specialists, some of the most popular Linux distributions are but are not limited to:

- [ParrotOS](https://www.parrotsec.org/)
- [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)
- [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)
- [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
- [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/)
- [BackBox](https://www.backbox.org/)
- [BlackArch](https://www.blackarch.org/)
- [Pentoo](https://www.pentoo.ch/)

The main differences between the various Linux distributions are the included packages, the user interface, and the tools available. Kali Linux is the most popular distribution for cyber security specialists, including a wide range of security-focused tools and packages. Ubuntu is widespread for desktop users, while [[Debian]] is popular for servers and embedded systems. Finally, red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS are popular for enterprise-level computing.
